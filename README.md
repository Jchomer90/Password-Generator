# Password-Generator

This project required I code the funtionality to this Password Generator. When the user clicks "Generate Password", there is a series of prompts. 

First, the user must confirm whether they want Special Characters included in their password - then lower case letters, followed by upper case letters, and finally numbers. The user must select one of these 4 options, otherwise they will be alerted that they need to select one. 

Next it will prompt the user to enter how many character their desired password should be. If the user selects between 8-128 characters, their password will appear in the text area!
